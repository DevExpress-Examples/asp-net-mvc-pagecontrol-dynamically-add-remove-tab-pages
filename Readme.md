# PageControl - How to dynamically add/remove tab pages


<p>This example illustrates how to dynamically add/remove PageControl's tabs on callbacks in MVC.</p><br />
<p>Tab data is passed to the PageControlPartial view as a model and is used to create tabs. Each tab information (its name, text) is stored in the TabInfo(MyTabInfo in VB.NET) class and passed to the TabPartial View as a model. You can expand this class with all required information that should be used in your tabs according to your scenario. To add/remove tabs, use CallbackPanel callbacks.</p>
